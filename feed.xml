                <p>This is an example page. It's different from a blog post because it will stay in one place and will show up in your site navigation (in most themes). Most people start with an About page that introduces them to potential site visitors. It might say something like this:</p>
<blockquote>Hi there! I'm a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my blog. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like pi&#241;a coladas. (And gettin' caught in the rain.)</blockquote>
<p>

...or something like this:</p>
<blockquote>The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing quality doohickeys to the public ever since. Located in Gotham City, XYZ employs over 2,000 people and does all kinds of awesome things for the Gotham community.</blockquote>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>The first stage is Chaos;
when people pretend to care,
to cover up for principles
that aren't really there.</p>
<p>They pretend to love,
and they think it's genuine;
but their relations with others
are fake, and self-serving.</p>
<p>Some may be quite disciplined,
and succeed in their profession;
but they remain unprincipled,
governed by their own will.</p>
<p>Many advance,
to the stage of Institutions,
when they submit themselves
to its laws and principles.</p>
<p>Dependent on the institution,
they do as their told;
but they often focus on its means,
and forget its goals.</p>
<p>They are threatened by those who think differently.
They have a “us against the world” mentality.</p>
<p>Some advance,
to the stage of Skepticism,
when they demand ideas that are
logical and tangible.</p>
<p>They are genuinely pro-social,
though individualistic;
which distinguishes them,
from the stage of the chaotic.</p>
<p>They are skeptical, and don't believe everything they have read.
They dismiss being institutionalized, in order to be saved.</p>
<p>They are abstracted from illusions,
and detached from institutions.
They don't live in extremes,
but somewhere in between.</p>
<p>However, they live in a dilemma
between mysticism and science,
and they can't decide
on where their heart is.</p>
<p>Some continue their seeking,
and a few find it,
and transcend
to the stage of Enlightenment.</p>
<p>They transcend their mind,
dilemmas and inhibitions;
their self, cultures, 
religions and institutions.</p>
<p>They find bliss, instead of 
walls they had thought to exist,
and see beauty, in the notion
of a one world family...</p>
<p>P.S. People can often be in flux;
they can advance or backslide,
so this shouldn't be taken intently,
it only serves as a rough guide...</p>

                <p>i see no light 
on a sunny day,
I hear no sound
on the freeway,
I feel no hunger
when i don't eat,
I feel tired when i sleep.</p>
<p>You think I’m tough,
but I’m not, I’m weak.
I'm physically strong,
but I can't take this heat. </p>
<p>I have no love or self respect;
I have no past, just regret:
I'm a king of confusion.
I’m a slave of emotion.
I’m a dupe of depression.</p>
<p>I hear no music
when i hear a tune,
I have no life
outside my room,
I set my clock
for 11 am,
i get up, 
and then sleep again. </p>
<p>I get no rest on a quiet night;
I fall away when I outta fight:
I'm a king of confusion.
I’m a slave of emotion.
I’m a dupe of depression.</p>
<p>You think I'm fearless,
but I’m not, I'm scared.
I look bold, 
but I'm timid instead.</p>
<p>My reality is faulty,
a bland - a tasteless story:
I'm a king of confusion.
I’m a slave of emotion.
I’m a dupe of depression.</p>

                <p>Decisions grow
and you feel low,
and pressing thoughts
they abrupt your flow,
and the road is steep
and your hurting deep.
You got nothing left
to make that leap.</p>
<p>If things aren’t going your way,
step back, but don’t walk away,
‘cause nothing is here to stay;
tomorrow is another day.</p>
<p>You look back;
you see regret,
failure, mistakes
you recollect,
different goals 
you shoulda set,
your thoughts - your choices,
they were mislead.</p>
<p>If things didn’t go your way,
let go, its okay,
‘cause nothing is here to stay;
today is a new day.</p>
<p>With today’s pace,
tomorrow is a distant place,
it’s dark and desolate.
And you contemplate,
the moves to make
to help mitigate
the uncertainty of fate...</p>
<p>What if things don’t go your way?
let go, don’t fall away,
‘cause nothing is here to stay;
Fight tomorrow's battles tomorrow
and today's battles today.</p>

that define the terms to which we practice,
and strive to be what everyone else is,
and ignore the truths by numbing our senses,
just to fit in with our bros and our lasses.</p>
<p>We cloth our bodies with jewels and crosses,
yet we're hungry, we live in darkness,
we ignore our wins but count our losses,
satisfaction is our temporary status.</p>
<p>And those people outside our boundaries,
they have no name no identities,
we trade their sweat to build our economies,
and yet of them is what our fear is.</p>
<p>And the media, they don't stay true,
they don't show what they're not supposed to,
they're no service, they're a business too.
Profit is their point of view.</p>
<p>And Entertainment, it's a funny word,
it is amusing, obscure and absurd.
it distracts us from our world...
it kills our time and it drives our herd.</p>

                <p>The engine is roaring
but everyone is quiet,
and its dark around me,
except for my reading light.</p>
<p>I'm on a greyhound bus,
'cause i couldn't get a flight;
my destination - Vancouver,
and i`ll be riding all night.</p>
<p>I thought I'd take this time
to write you`ll another letter;
as some of you`ll know,
I do this every quarter.</p>
<p>I have moved away for studies,
I think I had sent you`ll that memo...
its just a 2 hour ferry from Vancouver,
the city is called Nanaimo.</p>
<p>Nanaimo is a small city
with a population of about 90k.
It's a bit quiet, with not much to do,
but i like it that way.</p>
<p>It's a coastal city on an island,
with a relatively warmer weather,
a good place for a retiree
or a nature lover.</p>
<p>Anyway, I like its laid-back vibe,
especially at it's university,
and I have been doing well there so far
so I think its working out for me.</p>
<p>My last semester was great!
and i was sad to see it end,
'cause I enjoyed all the classes I took,
and my results were good as well.</p>
<p>I don't work part-time anymore,
and don't expect to next sem either,
so I`ll just be taking 4 core courses,
and try to intern in the summer.</p>
<p>I recently moved into an apartment there,
and said good bye to my dorm,
but I spent my last few weeks in Calgary,
I had some quality time at home!</p>
<p>We had a wonderful Christmas and New Years
- they were both memorable events.
Actually my whole holiday at home was amazing,
it didn't have any dull moments.</p>
<p>I should probably close soon,
for this rhyme is growing fast...
Do write back to me now,
whenever you`ll have a chance.</p>
<p>Also, send me your latest email address,
since my address book needs updating.
I don't wanna use Facebook for this no more,
it doesn't allow mass messaging.</p>
<p>Alright then, time to switch off my light
and put down my pen.
My seasons greetings to you,
and have a happy 2011!</p>

                <p><em>(Verse 1)</em>
So ur drivin in ur car
on that bright lit street,
lookin for some fun
and a place to eat.
The town 's goin quiet
n the nights growin long,
n ur gettin all restless
a thousand miles from home.</p>
<p><em>(Verse 2)</em>
Ur lookin for a break
from ur day-to-day life,
Ur lookin for a change
from what u left back.
but ur lookin for a new
that resembles the old.
U aien't lookin for change,
ur forgettin ur goal.</p>
<p><em>(Chorus 1)</em>
Why be a begger?
holdin a bowl,
askin the world
to fill your soul.
Nah... thats not how
its suppose to be,
u gotta be a king
n give ur self for free.</p>
<p><em>(Verse 3)</em>
So ur all dressed up
in those fancy clothes.
with gelled up hair
and a pimped up pose.
And all these folks
are below your nose,
'cause ur here for chicks
and to flaunt the bros.</p>
<p><em>(Chorus 2)</em>
You can't party
bein that proud,
wantin to be served
by the rest of the crowd.
Nah... thats not how
its suppose to go,
u gotta broaden ur mind
and start the show.</p>
<p><em>(Verse 4)</em>
So u seclude urself
in search of zeal,
and loose account of
what you feel.
U want a find
that will rid that rife,
and u search for that
instead of life.</p>
<p><em>(Chorus 1)</em>
Why be a begger?
holdin a bowl,
askin the world
to fill your soul.
Nah... thats not how
its suppose to be,
u gotta be a king
n give ur self for free.</p>
