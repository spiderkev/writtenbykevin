Going easy, on a seat. Was online on the laptop, with headphones playing my beat.</p><p>I had no class till an hour, and I was out of things to do. Yeah... I could've done my studies and assignments, but ah I wanted something new.</p><p>Was bored so i started looking around... I glanced toward the food counter, and I notice this girl in the line - waiting to place her order.</p><p>She was supported by 2 clutches: was leant on a pillar; was sholdering a backpack; and was just a person away from the cashier.</p><p>I think she asked for coffee and there were snacks along with it, I watched her grab the package and try to manage her clutches, holding it.</p><p>She staggered past me, slow to her step. I was afraid to turn to see what happened next.</p><p>Oddly the very evening, when I was leaving for the train I notice a guy in clutches, showing signs of pain.</p><p>He was climbing a few stairs, but he had a buddy to his left. When I walked passed it amazed me to find, that he was enjoying the fact of his effort!</p><p>I complain about how life treats me. I cant imagine lives like these. I respect those who can live normally. I admire those who can live happily.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 15, 2024</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/tags/poems/">Poems</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/authors/kevin/" rel="author">Kevin</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/testimonial-for-terance.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Testimonial for Terance</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/better-a-child-than-a-man.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Better a Child than a Man </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2006-12-02T19:45" class="feed__date">December 2, 2006</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/ironies-of-life.html">Ironies of Life</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
