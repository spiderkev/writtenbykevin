It's a bit quiet, with not much to do, but i like it that way.</p><p>It's a coastal city on an island, with a relatively warmer weather, a good place for a retiree or a nature lover.</p><p>Anyway, I like its laid-back vibe, especially at it's university, and I have been doing well there so far so I think its working out for me.</p><p>My last semester was great! and i was sad to see it end, 'cause I enjoyed all the classes I took, and my results were good as well.</p><p>I don't work part-time anymore, and don't expect to next sem either, so I`ll just be taking 4 core courses, and try to intern in the summer.</p><p>I recently moved into an apartment there, and said good bye to my dorm, but I spent my last few weeks in Calgary, I had some quality time at home!</p><p>We had a wonderful Christmas and New Years - they were both memorable events. Actually my whole holiday at home was amazing, it didn't have any dull moments.</p><p>I should probably close soon, for this rhyme is growing fast... Do write back to me now, whenever you`ll have a chance.</p><p>Also, send me your latest email address, since my address book needs updating. I don't wanna use Facebook for this no more, it doesn't allow mass messaging.</p><p>Alright then, time to switch off my light and put down my pen. My seasons greetings to you, and have a happy 2011!</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 15, 2024</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/authors/kevin/" rel="author">Kevin</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/walk-to-the-park-2.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Walk to the park</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/our-herd.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Our Herd </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
