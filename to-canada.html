It inspired me to some extent, and urged me back to Poetry!</p><p>This snowy Thursday morning, before my afternoon chemistry class, I thought of writing a poem, of this thing that changed my life.</p><p>Finally came the day, when our immigration process was through. After we had our visa's at hand, we started breaking the news.</p><p>We left Goa at the start of July, to Mumbai for a week, through Moscow to Toronto to my Uncles place, to spend a couple of weeks.</p><p>Belongings, family and friends.. we had to leave, to go through as we planned, to seek and live an unknown life, in this foreign land.</p><p>At Toronto we saw the CN tower, Naigra falls and had parties and fun, but then we flew to Calgary, and hence a new life has begun.</p><p>My uncle from USA and another priest, without their help we'd never be... we also met some nicest Calgarians, who even gave us things for free!</p><p>We got a comfortable accommodation, close to all amenities, its not shared, therefore rent is high, we pay $1200 + utilities.</p><p>Jobs are in plenty here, but a Good one is hard to find. My parents have jobs and my brother as well, and I work part time.</p><p>I am doing some upgrading for a year or two, before I get to university. but studies are very easy here, it shouldn't be a problem for me.</p><p>Ive already witnessed the extreme weather, a low of -18 degrees Celsius! Ive seen rain, snow and hail as well, but the worst we've yet to experience...</p><p>OH! I'm late for my chemistry class... "We're fine so far" - that's all i say. the present seems good and the future, bright and I pray it stays this way...</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 15, 2024</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/tags/poems/">Poems</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/authors/kevin/" rel="author">Kevin</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/ironies-of-life.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Ironies of Life</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/testimonial-for-rohit.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Testimonial for Rohit </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://spiderkev.github.io/writtenbykevin/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
