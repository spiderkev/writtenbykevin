They have a “us against the world” mentality.</p><p>Some advance, to the stage of Skepticism, when they demand ideas that are logical and tangible.</p><p>They are genuinely pro-social, though individualistic; which distinguishes them, from the stage of the chaotic.</p><p>They are skeptical, and don't believe everything they have read. They dismiss being institutionalized, in order to be saved.</p><p>They are abstracted from illusions, and detached from institutions. They don't live in extremes, but somewhere in between.</p><p>However, they live in a dilemma between mysticism and science, and they can't decide on where their heart is.</p><p>Some continue their seeking, and a few find it, and transcend to the stage of Enlightenment.</p><p>They transcend their mind, dilemmas and inhibitions; their self, cultures, religions and institutions.</p><p>They find bliss, instead of walls they had thought to exist, and see beauty, in the notion of a one world family...</p><p>P.S. People can often be in flux; they can advance or backslide, so this shouldn't be taken intently, it only serves as a rough guide...</p><p>Inspiration: Book: "People of the Lie," by M.
